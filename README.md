## Overview

This repository features a comprehensive simulation integrating quantum circuits, holographic entanglement entropy, and black hole thermodynamics to investigate the information paradox and the dynamics of quantum fields in curved spacetime. The findings provide valuable insights into phenomena such as Hawking radiation, black hole evaporation, and information preservation within quantum gravity.

### Quantum Hamiltonian

The quantum Hamiltonian used in these simulations captures the interactions between qubits, essential for determining the ground state energy using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) approach.

### Quantum Circuit

The quantum circuit involves:
1. Initializing qubits in superposition states using Hadamard gates.
2. Applying parameterized rotation gates to each qubit.
3. Entangling qubits using Controlled-X (CX) gates.
4. Measuring the expectation value of the Hamiltonian as the cost function for the VQE.

### Schwarzschild-AdS Metric

The Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) metric describes the spacetime geometry around non-rotating black holes in AdS space, providing a foundation for exploring black hole properties and behaviors.

### Reissner-Nordstr√∂m-AdS Metric

This metric extends the Schwarzschild-AdS solution to include charged black holes, allowing for the study of additional complexities introduced by electric charge.

### Minimal Surface Area

Calculating minimal surface areas in AdS space helps in understanding holographic principles and the geometry of spacetime influenced by black holes.

### Entropy

The entropy related to black hole surfaces is examined through the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, linking gravitational surface areas to thermodynamic properties.

### Hawking Temperature

The Hawking temperature describes the thermal radiation emitted by black holes, a key aspect of black hole thermodynamics and evaporation processes.

### Black Hole Evaporation

The rate at which black holes lose mass due to Hawking radiation is modeled, illustrating the gradual evaporation over time.

### Information Paradox

The information paradox is analyzed by comparing the initial and final entropies of black holes and their emitted radiation, addressing questions about information loss or preservation during black hole evaporation.
